        <h2>Kombucha</h2>
        <p>​
            is a fermented drink that has been brewed and consumed for over two millennia. The revitalizing effects of the beverage were recognized and used by many cultures around the world. Modern day studies on the health benefits of consuming fermented foods have only proven our ancestors right. Kombucha is loaded with vitamins and acids that help strengthen the immune system. It has probiotics and enzymes that are known to bolster digestion and replenish the good bacteria in your gut. Kombucha also boosts liver function, because it contains the same acids that the liver releases to eliminate toxins from the body.

        <h1>Brewed in Baltimore</h1>
        <p>
        Our parents introduced Adam and me to the art of fermentation back in 2000, when they taught us how to prepare sauerkraut. I have fond memories of weekends we spent together as a family, helping our parents prepare the fermentation tanks and learning how to use the cabbage shredders. I was roughly ten years old at the time, so to me the whole process was just another game. When the fermenting focus turned to brewing kombucha, I had fun playing pranks on my friends by giving them this strange new drink and watching their startled expressions when they realized what they were drinking was not orange juice or soda. Because of the tremendous health benefits associated with consuming fermented products, especially kombucha, our family continued brewing and experimenting with new flavors and styles of the drink. When they moved to Peru in 2009, they left all the fermentation canisters and bottling equipment with Adam. For the next several years, Adam experimented with different flavors and brewing techniques until he succeeded in making a crisp, bubbly, revitalizing, all natural drink. It was instantly a hit among our friends and some Johns Hopkins students who bought six-packs from time to time. But being in two successful rock-n-roll bands, attending university and working did not leave Adam with much time for kombucha.<br><br>At this time, like many young adults who have recently graduated college, I found myself in a limbo of sorts. I was in marketing and working a lot, but didn’t know if I wanted to pursue that as a career. Having been away at school for several years, I had yet to try this new recipe of kombucha that Adam had made; needless to say, I loved it! When I look back at how it all started, I remember having this aha moment just a few days after I started drinking that kombucha. It’s as if a veil was lifted from my eyes and I finally saw this amazing opportunity that had been right in front of me the whole time. Once I had a clear vision of what we could accomplish together, I pitched Adam on the idea of co-founding a company that would make and sell fermented products to our hometown community of Baltimore. Knowing we needed someone with more business experience, Adam and I shared the family tradition and business idea with our good friend Sid, who studied entrepreneurship at Duke University, and who I’ve known since the ninth grade. He was all for the idea and so, in the spring of 2014, Mobtown Fermentation was born. There is something to be said for the power of strength in numbers, and with the three of us on board, we soon began turning our vision into a reality. It’s been over a year now since we began, and during that time we have found a wonderful location in Hampden, perfected the style and flavors we now offer, and done our best to get the word out about Wild Kombucha. Today, we proudly introduce our unique brand of kombucha to you and all our friends in the Baltimore area. We hope you enjoy!
